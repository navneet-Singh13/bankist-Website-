#SUMMER TRENDS

JAVASCRIPT CONCEPTS LEARNT :- 


Event propagation - 
refers to the process by which events in JavaScript are handled as they move through the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy. When an event is triggered on an element, it first executes the event handlers attached to that element, then propagates to its parent elements until it reaches the top of the hierarchy (usually the document object). This process is known as event bubbling.

Event delegation - 
is a technique used in JavaScript to optimize event handling by attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple listeners to child elements. When an event is triggered on a child element, the event propagates up to the parent element, where the event listener can handle the event based on the target element.

Lazy loading - 
is a technique used to improve web page performance by loading content only when it is needed. This is particularly useful for large media files, such as images or videos, that can significantly slow down page load times. With lazy loading, these resources are only loaded when they become visible in the viewport, improving overall page load times.

The Intersection API -  
is a built-in JavaScript API that allows developers to detect when an element enters or leaves the viewport. This is particularly useful for implementing lazy loading or other performance optimizations. The Intersection API provides a more efficient way to determine when an element becomes visible than relying on scroll events or other methods.

DOM traversing - 
is the process of navigating through the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy to locate specific elements or nodes. There are several methods available in JavaScript for DOM traversing, including parentElement, children, nextSibling, previousSibling, and querySelector. These methods can be used to traverse the DOM tree in both a forward and backward direction.

Slider component - 
is a user interface element commonly used in web development to display a set of images or other content in a carousel-like manner. Sliders are often used to showcase products or services on an e-commerce website or to display featured content on a blog or news site.
